## Overview of the Analysis
In this project [New York Citi (NYC) Bike data (201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) is used to determine the bike-sharing business in New York City. We want to analyze this dataset to investigate whether the investment in a similar business for other cities (e.g., Des Mones) is worth it.
For doing this project, the following resources are utilized:
- Programming language: Python (version 3.8.8)- code is written in Jupyter Notebook.
- Dependency: Pandas library (version 1.3.0) 
- Visualization tool: Tableau Public 2021.3

## Results
In this section, the visualizations created by Tableau are demonstrated.

Figure 1 shows time duration that riders check out the bikes. As can be seen, during the first 5 minutes, most bikes (about 140k) are checked out.
